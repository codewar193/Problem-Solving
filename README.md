## Topic:  Binary Tree
 * Non-inear data structure
<p> The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Here, binary name itself suggests that 'two'; therefore, each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children.</p>

--> The above tree is a binary tree because each node contains the utmost two children. The logical representation of the above tree is given below:

## Topic: Bit Manipulation Algorithms
A bitwise operator is a character representing an action that works on data at the bit level rather than with bytes or larger units of data.
Bitwise operators can make some code faster and more efficient. Examples of uses of bitwise operations include encryption, compression, graphics, communications over ports/sockets, embedded systems programming and finite state machines.

Example-1: Swapping
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 65;
    int k = 120;
    printf(" value of i=%d k=%d before swapping", i, k);

    i = i ^ k;
    k = i ^ k;
    i = i ^ k;
    printf("value of i=%d k=%d after swapping", i, k);

    return 0;
}

## Topic: Pascal's Triangle

Pascal‚Äôs triangle is an array of binomial coefficients. The top row is numbered as n=0, and in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0. Each number is found by adding two numbers which are residing in the previous row and exactly top of the current cell. It is also being formed by finding (ùëõùëò) for row number n and column number k.

Suppose the input is 9, then the output will be like ‚àí
               
               1
              1 1
             1 2 1
            1 3 3 1
           1 4 6 4 1
         1 5 10 10 5 1
       1 6 15 20 15 6 1
      1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1
     1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1 
     
     
 # Topic:Code Optimization Using Hashing
 ## What is Hashing ?
 ‚Ä¢ Hashing is a technique of generating an index
for a key using a formula called Hash Function
to store and retrieve information efficiently.


‚Ä¢ It is used to perform optimal searches.

‚Ä¢ Generating an index or position for a key is
also known as Direct Addressing
